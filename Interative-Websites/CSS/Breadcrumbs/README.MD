## SECONDARY NAVIGATION 
### Breadcrumbs are usually displayed as a horizontal list of pages and take up minimal space. Users expect to find them in the header, left-aligned, and below any primary navigation. Typically they are separated with a “>” or a “/“ symbol.

### Breadcrumb Types:


- location - based on hierarchical structure of site
    ```
  Shopping > Food > Apples
  ```
  
- attribute - based on attributes of current page or item
  ```
   Apple: Red  Small
  ```
- path - unique to a user’s journey on the site 
   ```
   ... > About > Home > Login
   ```
