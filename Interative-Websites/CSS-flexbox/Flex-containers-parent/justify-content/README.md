# **CSS FLEXBOX**

## To position the items from left to right, we use a property called justify-content

### Five commonly used values for the justify-content property:



- flex-start — all items will be positioned in order, starting from the left of the parent container, with no extra space between or before them.
  
- flex-end — all items will be positioned in order, with the last item starting on the right side of the parent container, with no extra space between or after them.
  
- center — all items will be positioned in order, in the center of the parent container with no extra space before, between, or after them
  
- space-around — items will be positioned with equal space before and after each item, resulting in double the space between elements.
  
- space-between — items will be positioned with equal space between them, but no extra space before the first or after the last elements.
