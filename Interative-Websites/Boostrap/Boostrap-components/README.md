### [Jumbotron Component ](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/components/jumbotron/)

-  The jumbotron component which prominently displays an image or text.

---
## [Adding a Card](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/components/card/#example)

- Card components are often grouped together to display a collection of similar content in manageable chunks.
- By default, this card will take up the entire width of its parent element.
- The content inside the card body all have classes with "card-{value}" which adds styling to these elements specific for Bootstrap cards.
- The card component that acts as a stylized content container.
  
```
<div class="card">
  <img class="card-img-top" src="placeholder.jpg" alt="card example image">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Card title</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Card description goes here.</p>
    <a href="#" class="card-link">Link to somewhere.</a>
   </div>
</div>
```

---
## [The Carousel Component](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/components/carousel/)

- The carousel component to create a slideshow which displays images or text.

```
<div id="carouselExampleSlidesOnly" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel">
  <div class="carousel-inner">
    <div class="carousel-item active">
      <img class="d-block w-100" src="example_slide_1.png" alt="First slide">
    </div>
    <div class="carousel-item">
      <img class="d-block w-100" src="example_slide_2.png" alt="Second slide">
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

 - The parent div element has an id of "carouselExampleSlidesOnly", two classes "carousel" and "slide", and the attribute data-ride="carousel".
   - The id is used later when we want to add controls to click between slides.
  
   - The data-ride attribute provides the interactivity and slide transitions.

- We also have a nested div class="carousel-inner" element that contains other  elements with images. 
  
 - Nested inside the 2nd div is with a class of "carousel-item" and "active" (only one image needs the active class, if none have active, no images are shown).

- The img elements use two utility classes"d-block" sets its display as block and the "w-100" is to take up 100% of the width.
