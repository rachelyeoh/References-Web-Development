## **Flex-wrap ** 

### The flex-wrap property is declared on flex containers.

#### The flex-wrap property can accept three values:

- wrap — child elements of a flex container that don’t fit into a row will move down to the next line.
  
- wrap-reverse — the same functionality as wrap, but the order of rows within a flex container is reversed (for example, in a 2-row flexbox, the first row from a wrap container will become the second in wrap-reverse and the second row from the wrap container will become the first in wrap-reverse).
  
- nowrap — prevents items from wrapping; this is the **default value** and is only necessary to override a wrap value set by a different CSS rule.
